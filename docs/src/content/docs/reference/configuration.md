title: Configuration
description: Every file, key and environment variable New Tricks reads, with defaults and complete annotated examples.
---

New Tricks reads three files: the source repo manifest `tricks.toml`, its generated `tricks.lock`, and your user config. All are TOML. Only the keys on this page are read; New Tricks ignores anything else.

| File | Where | Committed | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`tricks.toml`](#source-repo-manifest-trickstoml) | Source repo root | Yes | You, `init`, `create`, `vendor`, `remove` |
| [`tricks.lock`](#lock-file-trickslock) | Source repo root | Yes | New Tricks only |
| [User config](#user-config) | `~/.config/newtricks/tricks.toml` | No | You, first run, `init`, `catalog` |

When New Tricks edits `tricks.toml` or the user config, it keeps your comments and formatting.

## Source repo manifest: `tricks.toml`

The manifest holds intent: which skills the repo has, where they came from, and how to lint and publish them. See [Source repo](/tricks/concepts/source-repo/).

### `[source-repo]`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | The directory name | The repo's name: its key in the user config's `[source-repos]`, and the fallback for the marketplace owner and description when publishing. Set by `init --name`. |
| `agents` | array of strings | The user setting `settings.agents` | Agents to link this repo's skills for: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `copilot`, or `"all"`. `link --agents` overrides it for one command. See [Agents](/tricks/concepts/agents/). |

### `[skills.<name>]`

One table per skill. The table key is the skill's name in the source repo, which is also the directory name its links get in agent directories.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Required | The skill's directory, relative to the repo root. `create` and `vendor` use `skills/<name>`. |
| `upstream` | string | None (an original) | Canonical ID of the upstream skill, `host/owner/repo//path`, or a catalog-hosted ID such as `clawhub.ai/<owner>/skills//<slug>`. Set by `vendor`. See [Upstream tracking](/tricks/concepts/upstream/). |
| `track` | string | `"latest"` | What `outdated` and `update` compare against: `"latest"` (the highest semver tag, else the default branch), a version such as `"v1.2.0"` (that tag), or a branch name. `vendor` writes the branch when you vendor at `@<branch>`, else `"latest"`. |
| `update` | string | `"review"` | Update policy for a vendored skill. `review`: upstream changes are reported by `list` and `outdated` and merged by `update`. `pinned`: stays on its base; `update` with no skill skips it, and `outdated` notes the new version. `paused`: not checked; `outdated` and `update` skip it unless you name it. |
| `license-override` | inline table | None | `{ justification = "…" }`: allows publishing a vendored skill whose licence would otherwise block it; the licence gate then reports it as allowed by override, as a warning. Record why you have permission in the justification. A blocked licence gate prints the exact snippet to add. See [Publishing](/tricks/concepts/publishing/). |

### `[lint]`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ignore` | array of strings | `[]` | Rule codes to skip in every skill, such as `"NT305"`. Codes must match exactly. |
| `strict-spec` | boolean | `false` | Treat any frontmatter key outside the Agent Skills spec as an error, as the reference validator does. Same as `lint --strict`. |
| `per-skill.<name>.ignore` | array of strings | `[]` | Rule codes to skip for one skill, in a `[lint.per-skill.<name>]` table. |

A skill can also disable rules inline in its frontmatter, with `tricks-lint-disable` under `metadata` (codes separated by commas or spaces); the key is stripped when publishing. See [Lint](/tricks/concepts/lint/) and the [rule table](/tricks/reference/lint-rules/).

### `[publish.targets.<target>]`

One table per publish target; `<target>` is the name you pass to `tricks publish`.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repo` | string | Required | The distribution repository: `owner/repo`, `host/owner/repo`, a git URL, or a path (relative paths resolve against the repo root) to a repository that accepts pushes, such as a bare repository. |
| `skills` | array of strings | `["*"]` | Skills to publish, by name; `"*"` means all of them. |
| `exclude` | array of strings | `[]` | Globs of files to leave out, relative to each skill directory, such as `"evals/**"`. |
| `plugins` | table of arrays | `{}` | Optional plugin groups for the generated `marketplace.json`, in a `[publish.targets.<target>.plugins]` table: `group = ["skill", …]`. Skills not in a group go into the default plugin. |
| `marketplace` | string | The target repository's name | Marketplace name in `marketplace.json`. Must be kebab-case and not a name Claude Code reserves. |
| `owner` | string | Your `git config user.name`, else the source repo name | Marketplace owner name. |
| `description` | string | `"Agent skills published from <name>"` | Plugin description in `marketplace.json`. |

### Complete example

```toml
# ~/code/my-skills/tricks.toml

[source-repo]
name   = "my-skills"                  # default: the directory name
agents = ["claude", "codex"]          # default: settings.agents from the user config

[skills.changelog-writer]             # an original: no upstream
path = "skills/changelog-writer"

[skills.skill-creator]                # a vendored skill
path     = "skills/skill-creator"
upstream = "github.com/anthropics/skills//skills/skill-creator"
track    = "latest"                   # highest semver tag, else the default branch
update   = "review"                   # review | pinned | paused

[skills.invoice]                      # catalog-hosted upstream
path     = "skills/invoice"
upstream = "clawhub.ai/acme/skills//invoice"
license-override = { justification = "Separate redistribution agreement with Acme" }

[lint]
ignore      = ["NT305"]               # skip everywhere
strict-spec = false                   # true: unknown frontmatter keys are errors

[lint.per-skill.skill-creator]
ignore = ["NT206"]                    # skip for this skill only

[publish.targets.public]
repo        = "acme/my-skills-public" # owner/repo, host/owner/repo, git URL or path
skills      = ["*"]                   # default: all skills
exclude     = ["evals/**", "notes/**", "*.draft.md"]
marketplace = "acme-skills"           # default: the target repository's name
owner       = "Acme"                  # default: git config user.name
description = "Acme's agent skills"

[publish.targets.public.plugins]      # optional groups in marketplace.json
documents = ["invoice"]
authoring = ["skill-creator", "changelog-writer"]
```

## Lock file: `tricks.lock`

Generated; don't edit it. It records what New Tricks resolved for each vendored skill, so `update` knows the common ancestor for its three-way merge and `publish` knows each skill's licence. Originals have no entry.

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | integer | Lock format version, currently `1`. |
| `skills.<name>.base` | string | The upstream revision last incorporated: a commit SHA, `clawhub:<version>` or `sha256:<digest>` for catalog-hosted upstreams. |
| `skills.<name>.base_tree` | string | Git tree hash of the upstream skill directory at `base`. `list` compares it with your copy to decide whether the skill is `customized`. |
| `skills.<name>.upstream_path` | string | The upstream's new path, if upstream renamed or moved the skill since you vendored it. |
| `skills.<name>.license` | table | Detected licence: `spdx` (the SPDX expression, if any), `class` (`allow`, `weak-copyleft`, `strong-copyleft`, `non-commercial` or `block`), `source` (where it was found: `skill-file`, `frontmatter`, `repo-root`, `github-api` or `catalog-terms`) and `confidence` (0 to 1). |

```toml
# Generated by New Tricks. Do not edit.
version = 1

[skills.skill-creator]
base = "33375500bcea98d610eb30ce10ac4e59b89c390d"
base_tree = "3cf9a8db32597ba3e24b584a3d696f4e11c7d7b6"

[skills.skill-creator.license]
spdx = "Apache-2.0"
class = "allow"
source = "skill-file"
confidence = 1.0
```

## User config

Settings for your machine, the catalogs `search` draws on, and your registered source repos. It holds no skills: New Tricks does not install skills on your machine.

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS, Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newtricks/tricks.toml`, default `~/.config/newtricks/tricks.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\newtricks\tricks.toml` |

The first run writes this file with the default settings, the agents it finds on your machine and the recommended catalogs, so nothing search uses is hidden. An existing file is never rewritten.

### `[settings]`

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agents` | array of strings | The agents found on first run, else `["claude"]` | Agents to link and try skills for when neither the command (`--agents`) nor the source repo (`[source-repo] agents`) says: `claude`, `codex`, `cursor`, `copilot`, or `"all"`. The first run lists the agents it finds: their directories in your home (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.cursor`, `~/.copilot`), a Copilot extension in VS Code, or their commands on `PATH`. See [Agents](/tricks/concepts/agents/). |
| `fetch_interval` | string | `"24h"` | How long fetched catalogs and upstreams count as fresh. A number and a unit: `s`, `m`, `h` or `d`, such as `"30m"`. |
| `live` | array of strings | `["skills.sh", "tessl", "clawhub", "github"]` | Live-query catalogs asked on every search. `[]` turns them all off; `search --no-live` skips them for one search. |

### `[source-repos]`

Registered source repos, `name = "path"`. `init` adds the repo it initializes; delete a line to unregister one. Outside a source repo, `list` shows these, and `list --links --all`, `unlink --all` and `doctor` use them. See [Source repo](/tricks/concepts/source-repo/#registered-source-repos).

### `[catalogs]`

Where `search` looks, one entry per catalog: `"<key>" = {}` or `"<key>" = { kind = "…" }`. Manage them with [`tricks catalog`](/tricks/reference/commands/catalog/); `catalog add --recommended` restores any missing recommended ones.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | Detected from the key | `repo`: a skill repository (`github.com/owner/repo`). `marketplace`: a Claude or APM `marketplace.json` repository. `wellknown`: a site serving `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json` (keys starting with `https://` on non-GitHub hosts). `pointers`: an `apm.yml` or `skills-lock.json` file (keys ending in those names). |

See [Discovery](/tricks/concepts/discovery/).

### Complete example

```toml
# ~/.config/newtricks/tricks.toml

[settings]
agents = ["claude", "codex"]          # default: the agents found on first run, else ["claude"]
fetch_interval = "24h"                # s | m | h | d
live = ["skills.sh", "tessl", "clawhub", "github"]   # [] for none

[source-repos]
my-skills = "~/code/my-skills"
team      = "~/code/acme-skills"

[catalogs]
"github.com/anthropics/skills" = {}                     # recommended
"github.com/openai/skills" = {}                         # recommended
"github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills" = {}              # recommended
"github.com/github/awesome-copilot" = {}                # recommended
"github.com/obra/superpowers" = {}                      # recommended
"github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official" = { kind = "marketplace" }
"https://skills.example.com" = { kind = "wellknown" }
"~/code/my-app/apm.yml" = { kind = "pointers" }
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TRICKS_HOME` | The home directory New Tricks uses: user scope agent directories (`~/.claude/skills` and so on), agent detection on first run, `~` in config paths, and the default config and data locations. Default: your home directory. |
| `TRICKS_CONFIG_DIR` | Directory holding the user config `tricks.toml`. |
| `TRICKS_DATA_DIR` | Data directory (see [below](#data-directory)). |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | On macOS and Linux, the user config lives in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newtricks` when set. |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | On Linux, the data directory is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/newtricks` when set. |
| `TRICKS_GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API token; checked first. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub API token; checked after `TRICKS_GITHUB_TOKEN`, before `gh auth token`. |
| `TRICKS_NO_GH` | When set, don't ask `gh auth token` for a token. |
| `TRICKS_LINK_MODE` | Override how skills are placed: `copy` (every agent copies), `link` (every agent links), or per agent, `agent=mode,…` such as `copilot=link,claude=copy`. Unlisted agents keep their default. See [Agents](/tricks/concepts/agents/). |
| `TRICKS_RELEASE_REPO` | Repository `tricks upgrade` downloads releases from. Default: `new-tricks/tricks`. |

For hermetic tests and CI, New Tricks also reads `TRICKS_HOST_MAP` (map a host to a local directory of repositories, `github.com=/path/to/fixtures`, where `<dir>/<owner>/<repo>` are git repositories), `TRICKS_NO_API` (index GitHub repositories with git instead of the GitHub API), `TRICKS_SKILLS_SH_URL`, `TRICKS_TESSL_URL` and `TRICKS_CLAWHUB_URL` (catalog endpoints), and `TRICKS_IDENTITY` and `TRICKS_STARRED` (a fixed GitHub identity and starred list for the trust facet).

New Tricks sets two variables itself: `TRICKS_EXPERIMENT=<skill>@<name>` in the shell that `experiment shell` (or `experiment start --shell`) opens, and `TRICKS_VSCODE_TOKEN` when the VS Code extension passes its GitHub session to the binary.

## Data directory

Caches and state live in a platform-native, non-hidden location where the platform allows, because Cursor skips skills behind hidden directories:

| Platform | Data directory |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/newtricks` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/newtricks`, default `~/.local/share/newtricks` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\newtricks` |

| Inside | What |
|---|---|
| `store/` | Read-only, content-addressed skill revisions: trials, snapshots for links pinned to a tag or commit, catalog-hosted bases. A cache; `unlink` prunes it. |
| `repos/<host>/<owner>/<repo>/` | Fetch-only mirrors of upstream repositories. Never pushed. |
| `publish/` | New Tricks' own clones of publish targets, reset to the remote before every publish. |
| `backups/` | Skills moved aside by `link --shadow`, restored on unlink. |
| `state.db` | SQLite: search index, links and trials, fetch times, interrupted operations. |

[`tricks doctor`](/tricks/reference/commands/doctor/) shows the config and data directories in use.
