# Formula for the new-tricks/homebrew-tap tap (Formula/tricks.rb; was newtricks until
# 0.6, which the tap's formula_renames.json maps to it).
#   brew install new-tricks/tap/tricks
# This is the template: on each release, .github/workflows/release.yml renders it with
# the tag's source tarball `url` and `sha256` (packaging/homebrew/render.sh) and pushes
# it to the tap. Submit to homebrew-core once the project meets its notability
# requirements.
